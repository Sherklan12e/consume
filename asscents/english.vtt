with a beautiful wife

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
Letting the days go by

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
Letting the days go by

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
Water flowing under

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000

Water flowing under

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
And you may ask yourself

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
How do I work this?

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
And you may ask yourself

01:15.000 --> 01:18.000
Where is that large automobile?

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
This is not my beautiful house

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
And you may tell yourself

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
This is not my beautiful wife

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
Letting the days go by

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
Let the water hold me down

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
Letting the days go by

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
Water holding
